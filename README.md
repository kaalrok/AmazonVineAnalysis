# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Overview of the analysis of the Vine Program
The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review. In this project, we will randomly choose a data set of reviews from the Amazon Vine program. We will analyze the data to see if the paid reviews are biased or not. 

## Results of the Analysis
We found that there was no bias for the paid reviews vs the unpaid reviews. We specifically tested the 5 star reviews as statistically that is what buyers look for in purchasing a product. In fact of the reviews (paid and unpaid), we found that the unpaid reviews had 12% more 5 star reviews than the paid reviews. Here is our findings:

    - How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
        - There were 334 Vine reviews
        - There were 61,614 non-Vine reviews

    - How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
        - There were 139 Vine reviews with a 5 star rating
        - There were 32,665 non-Vine reviews with a 5 star rating

    - What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
        - 41.62% of Vine reviews were 5 stars
        - 52.02% of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars

## Summary Statements
The percentage of 5 star ratings is not the same when comparing vine reviews to non-vine reviews. There is no reason to believe that the percentage of 5 star reviews is directly tied to whether a review is paid for or not. 

For further analysis, one could evaluate the proportion of 5 star reviews among the samples.
